**Counter Project**

This is a simple and interactive Counter application built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to increase, decrease or reset a numeric value with button clicks.

📝 What Does It Do?

The Counter project provides a clean and minimal interface to manipulate a number dynamically.

Increase: Increments the counter value.

Decrease: Decrements the counter value.

Reset: Resets the counter back to zero.

Real-Time Update: Changes are instantly reflected on the screen.

⚙️ How Does It Work?

The project is built using basic DOM manipulation and event handling:

HTML Structure: Defines the counter display and control buttons.

CSS Styling: Provides simple styling for layout and buttons.

DOM Selection: JavaScript selects buttons and the counter value using querySelector.

Event Listeners: Each button listens for click events.

State Update: The counter value is updated and rendered dynamically in the UI.

🎓 What Have I Learned?

By building this project, I improved my understanding of:

DOM Manipulation: Updating text content dynamically.

Event Handling: Using click events to trigger logic.

JavaScript Logic: Managing state with variables and conditions.

Clean Code Structure: Writing readable and maintainable vanilla JavaScript.
